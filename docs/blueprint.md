# **App Name**: GridSim

## Core Features:

- Node Simulation: Simulate nodes with varying load values that change every second.
- Connection Simulation: Simulate load transfer between connected nodes.
- Instability Simulation: Model node instability when capacity is exceeded, and simulate its effect on connected nodes.
- Visual System State: Display the grid system's current state visually using a graph representation.
- Simulation Controls: Provide UI controls to pause, resume, and reset the simulation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to represent stability and power.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9100) to highlight unstable nodes and critical alerts.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for readability and a modern look.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent nodes, connections, and control actions (play, pause, reset).
- A clear, force-directed graph layout that updates dynamically to reflect the system state.
- Subtle animations to indicate load changes and instability events. Pulsing glows on nodes indicate load, and bright flashing indicates instability.
